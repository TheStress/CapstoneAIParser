We are a team of developers, designers, and analysts who are committed to helping businesses solve problems using state-of-the-art technology. We believe that the best results are achieved by people who are passionate about what they do and continually strive to be better - those are the people we hire\n...\nWho we are looking for:\nA senior freelance Front End developer to accelerate our mobile apps for 311 systems used by major cities across the USA. You will work as part of an existing development team well under way to design and develop our next generation 311 mobile app using React Native. We use the same RN codebase to also build an analogous mobile web app.\n\u2022 We can get a good candidate started immediately, and we have a pipeline of new screens from our designer coming in daily for the next several weeks.\n\u2022 We\u2019ll likely use someone between 3-6 hours/day for the next 4-6 weeks - could be more work post this assignment.\n\nProject Context\n\u2022 Incapsulate is building a web application for which we want true responsive design between desktop web and mobile web form factors.\n\u2022 We will have expertly designed wireframes coupled with high fidelity mock ups for both renditions (desktop web, mobile web) where at least 90% of our screens layouts should be responsive through pure CSS alone (i.e. without special server side rendering).\n\u2022 We have strong front-end developers working with Salesforce Lightning Web Components. They are doing all of this work right now, but we want to free them up from the raw HTML/CSS/Responsive web design front end work.\n\u2022 We want a front end developer who can take the wireframes and high fidelity mock ups, and cut the HTML and CSS for us (standardizing styles for reused conventions and patterns in the front end as they go, and not just for achieving responsive design for varied form factors).\n\nIdeal Candidate\n\u2022 Strong skills with multiple implementations of responsive design for web apps (i.e. brochureware static websites don\u2019t count). The candidate will need to cite which apps (not static sites) they\u2019ve done this for, in order to be considered.\n\u2022 Uses a framework like Bootstrap (we\u2019re open to others) so that the approach can easily be understood by our team too.\n\u2022 Has a strong knowledge of CSS such that they could make our app responsive even without a framework. This ensures the candidate knows when and how to handle complex scenarios that don\u2019t neatly fit into textbook solutions offered by frameworks. The candidate will be tested on their raw CSS knowledge in our technical screening in order to qualify.\n\nOur Environment & Technologies\n\u2022 Distributed team in both India and the USA\n\u2022 React Native with Expo\n\u2022 Salesforce back end\n\u2022 Typescript\n\u2022 JS\n\u2022 GitHub\n\u2022 Design mockups in Figma - provided for us by professional UI/UX designers\n\u2022 ADA compliance (accessibility) a big part of the app\n\u2022 Incapsulate is an Equal Opportunity Employer (EOE).
