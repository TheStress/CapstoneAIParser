        "description": "Who we are\n\nWe're building a prayer and meditation app. One that is authentically Christian and Catholic, while at the same time a resource for anyone looking to grow deeper in a relationship with God. We believe that people are hungry for peace, and that there is no surer way to find it than by learning to sit in silence with Christ: \u201cCome to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy... burdens, and I will give you rest\u201d (Mt 11:28).\n\nOur goal is to build something truly great. Something that combines the beauty of the Church\u2019s spirituality with world-class product and content execution.\n\nWe launched the app in December of 2018 and have been blown away with the incredible growth & traction. Hallow has been downloaded over 10 million times with over 200,000 5-star reviews. We're blessed to be backed by some of the best mission-driven investors in the world and are excited to build out the team to help a lot more folks grow closer to God.\n\nWe are a startup. We move quickly and take big swings. We are a small and fast moving team and each person is responsible for making an impact. It is hard work, but also deeply meaningful. We\u2019d be honored & humbled if you\u2019d consider joining us.\n\nTldr: We are scaling up our dev team and looking for someone who help code the iOS version of the app (in Swift).\nWhat You'll Do\n\n\u2022 Build the app: Build a best-in-class native Swift mobile app to help our users pray and meditate around the world\n\u2022 Build out the product: Work closely within a product pod alongside other developers and designers in an agile environment to implement designs, interfaces, and animations into our app\n\u2022 Collaborate: Participate in design and code reviews, working closely with other devs.\n\u2022 Optimize: Architect frameworks for allowing A/B testing of content, fine-tune media streaming to enable our content to be accessible worldwide\n\nWhat You'll Love\n\n\u2022 Mission: This work is incredibly humbling. Everyday we hear amazing stories and we get the pleasure of working on something that\u2019s impacting lives. One of our favorite user quotes: \u201cI hate quoting an old, overused cliche, but I\u2019ve been very lost. And I think for the first time in a while I may be found.\u201d\n\u2022 Ownership: When a company is this small, every employee is a core team member with an outsized impact. You'll own the entire codebase for your vertical within a product pod from start to finish.\n\u2022 Growth: From day 1, you\u2019ll be a part of the startup journey. We went from less than 10 to over 60 in the past 2 years, and we\u2019ll need your help to create a world-class team and get individuals praying in more countries around the world.\n\u2022 Flexibility: We operate as a remote first team with members all over the globe. We don\u2019t care when or where you work just that it gets done! That being said, our HQ is in Chicago and if in person work is something you are interested in we'd love to have you there!\n\u2022 Comp: We will pay competitive market rates both in terms of equity, cash, & benefits.\n\nWhat We're Looking For\n\n\u2022 Passion: First and foremost, we\u2019re looking for someone excited and passionate about our mission. It makes it a lot more fun to actually care about what you\u2019re working on!\n\u2022 Experience: A foundation of 2+ years of experience in Swift and iOS development in general; experience working on other apps that use MediaPlayer or media streaming; an attention for detail with regards to design and crafting user interfaces; knowledge of application architecture and design; experience building reactive applications that interact with live content\n\u2022 Bonus, but not required: experience with CarPlay or WatchOS\n\u2022 Grit & Detail-Oriented: We really care about what we\u2019re doing & try to build as fast as we can. Since we\u2019re guided meditation and competing with some large players in the market (Calm, Headspace), we have to stand out. Everything we do, say, send, or spend money on should be top-notch quality and set Hallow apart as the best.\n\nWe are honored that you'd consider joining the team and look forward to connecting with you.\n\nBest,\n\nAlex at Hallow\nCEO & Co-Founder",

Everything we do is aligned with our collective vision of a future world where all people develop the inner resources to cultivate happiness. Our mission is to help people see more clearly what leads to happiness (and what doesn\u2019t... by supporting the initiation and deepening of our customers' meditation practice.\n\nWe work towards our vision of the world everyday through six shared values:\n\u2022 Human First. We deeply care for each other, and we're unafraid of bringing this care into our work. We see, support, and celebrate each other as humans - flaws and all - with grace and compassion.\n\u2022 Own Your Shit. We name our foibles, allowing us to work with them, rather than being driven blindly by them.\n\u2022 Say The Hard Thing. We owe it to each other to speak up. Hard feedback, delivered skillfully, helps our colleagues grow and is great for business.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t Side With Yourself. We have a deeply rooted tendency to cling to our views. We strive to escape our subjectivity and appreciate other perspectives.\n\u2022 Build More Skateboards. Innovation requires rapid iteration and failure. World-changing ideas always start out woefully inadequate, even embarrassing. When we understand this, we stop criticizing the skateboards and start extending trust.\n\u2022 For Us All. We welcome the innate value that comes from diverse experiences. We are invested in creating a collaborative and equitable work environment where each of us feels supported, valued, and recognized for our unique contribution to what we collectively produce, and where we each feel a sense of belonging.\n\nWe ask interested folks to carefully assess their excitement about our vision and values as they are central to mutual happiness in any role at Ten Percent.\n\nYour Role\n\nMaintain and improve overall app architecture, pay down tech debt, and collaborate with the product, design, and backend engineering teams to design, develop, and release consumer product features to our ever-growing user base.\n\nWhat you will do\n\u2022 Write and review code written in Swift\n\u2022 Contribute to the product development lifecycle, including helping to draft technical specs, leading the mobile development, defining QA guidelines, and releasing to users.\n\u2022 Drive helpful conversations around technical issues, architecture, and engineering practices and suggest improvements and ideas as you see them.\n\u2022 Stay informed on the latest news and trends in the iOS ecosystem and bring those learnings to the team for integration.\n\nWhat you will bring to the team\n\u2022 2+ years of professional software development experience designing/developing iOS applications\n\u2022 Experience building responsive interfaces in UIKit using AutoLayout.\n\u2022 An understanding of software design patterns and architecture.\n\u2022 Experience using a reactive programming paradigm such as RxSwift or ReactiveSwift.\n\u2022 Experience working with mobile databases such as Realm, SQLite, or Core Data\n\u2022 Experience designing client-server APIs and implementing iOS networking layers.\n\u2022 Bonus: Familiarity with iOS accessibility features, such as Dynamic Type and VoiceOver.\n\u2022 Bonus: Familiarity with Android or Ruby on Rails.\n\nWho you will work with\n\u2022 You will report directly to DeRon Brown, Director of Engineering (https://www.linkedin.com/in/deron-brown-20372012)\n\u2022 You will work alongside:\n\u2022 Jess Melanson-Thomas (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessmelanson/)\n\u2022 Hector Rodriguez (https://www.linkedin.com/in/hectorlr/)\n\u2022 Anthony Moffa (https://www.linkedin.com/in/amoffa/)\n\u2022 Peter Smith-Vondras (https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-smith-vondras/)\n\nWhy we think you'll like working here\n\u2022 We work in a brand new dog-friendly office in downtown Boston (although your welcome to work remotely).\n\u2022 You\u2019ll become a part of a growing company that is changing people's lives for the better.\n\u2022 We foster a culture that values clear and kind communication.

We aim to cultivate a culture that is steeped in the values and practices that we promote through our products and media channels. We welcome the cultural enrichment that comes from diverse experiences in education, class background, age, culture, ethnicity, race, color, sex, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, nation of origin, languages spoken, able-bodiedness, religion and beliefs.

Together, we're changing the way the world invests.\n\nFor us, investing doesn't just end in value. It starts with values. Because when you invest with courage, when you invest with clarity, and when you invest with care, you can get so much more in return. We invest with purpose - and that's how we've become a global market leader. Here, we grow by doing the right thing for the people we serve. And so can you.\n\nWe want to make success accessible to everyone. This is our opportunity. Let's make it count.\n\nInclusion Statement\n\nVanguard's continued commitment to diversity and inclusion is firmly rooted in our culture. Every decision we make to best serve our clients, crew (internally employees are referred to as crew), and communities is guided by one simple statement: \"Do the right thing.\"\n\nWe believe that a critical aspect of doing the right thing requires building diverse, inclusive, and highly effective teams of individuals who are as unique as the clients they serve. We empower our crew to contribute their distinct strengths to achieving Vanguard's core purpose through our values.\n\nWhen all crew members feel valued and included, our ability to collaborate and innovate is amplified, and we are united in delivering on Vanguard's core purpose.\n\nOur core purpose: To take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success.\n\nFuture of Work\n\nDuring the pandemic, we transitioned to a work from home model for the majority of our crew and we continue to interview, hire, and on-board future crew remotely.\n\nAs we have developed the path forward, we have taken a thoughtful approach that both maximizes the advantages of working remotely and the many benefits of coming together and collaborating in a shared workspace. We believe that in-person interactions among our crew are important for preserving our unique culture and advantageous for the personal development of our crew.\n\nWhen our Crew return to the office, many will work in our hybrid model. A smaller proportion of our crew will operate in the Work from Home work model (for example, field sales crew); or in the Work from Office model (for example, portfolio managers).\n\nThe working model that your role falls into will be communicated to you in the interview process - please do ask if you are unsure. We encourage you to make the decision regarding your job interview and offer knowing which model your role will fall into. We will test and learn as our ways of working evolve and will continue to evaluate working models along the way",

You\u2019ll build user-facing features for Here centered around personalization, real-time interaction, and high quality, reliable video communications.\n\u2022 You have the opportunity (requirement) to continually learn, teach, and step outside your comfort zone.\n\u2022 You will work closely with an experienced founding team and get exposed to the early days and decisions that will make a startup successful.\n\u2022 You will be responsible for the end-to-end execution of projects - from conception, through implementation, and measurement - that change the trajectory of Here.\n\u2022 As Here grows, your role will grow.
