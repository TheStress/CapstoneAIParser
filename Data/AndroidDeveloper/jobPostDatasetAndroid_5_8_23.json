Because when you invest with courage, when you invest with clarity, and when you invest with care, you can get so much more in return. We invest with purpose \u2013 and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve become a global market leader. Here, we grow by doing the right thing for the people we serve. And so can you.\n\nWe want to make success accessible to everyone. This is our opportunity. Let\u2019s make it count.\n\nInclusion Statement\n\nVanguard\u2019s continued commitment to diversity and inclusion is firmly rooted in our culture. Every decision we make to best serve our clients, crew (internally employees are referred to as crew), and communities is guided by one simple statement: \u201cDo the right thing.\u201d\n\nWe believe that a critical aspect of doing the right thing requires building diverse, inclusive, and highly effective teams of individuals who are as unique as the clients they serve. We empower our crew to contribute their distinct strengths to achieving Vanguard\u2019s core purpose through our values.\n\nWhen all crew members feel valued and included, our ability to collaborate and innovate is amplified, and we are united in delivering on Vanguard's core purpose.\n\nOur core purpose: To take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success.\n\nFuture of Work\n\nDuring the pandemic, we transitioned to a work from home model for the majority of our crew and we continue to interview, hire, and on-board future crew remotely.\n\nAs we have developed the path forward, we have taken a thoughtful approach that both maximizes the advantages of working remotely and the many benefits of coming together and collaborating in a shared workspace. We believe that in-person interactions among our crew are important for preserving our unique culture and advantageous for the personal development of our crew.\n\nWhen our Crew return to the office, many will work in our hybrid model. A smaller proportion of our crew will operate in the Work from Home work model (for example, field sales crew); or in the Work from Office model (for example, portfolio managers).\n\nThe working model that your role falls into will be communicated to you in the interview process \u2013 please do ask if you are unsure. We encourage you to make the decision regarding your job interview and offer knowing which model your role will fall into. We will test and learn as our ways of working evolve and will continue to evaluate working models along the way",

Together, we're changing the way the world invests.\n\nFor us, investing doesn't just end in value. It starts with values. Because when you invest with courage, when you invest with clarity, and when you invest with care, you can get so much more in return. We invest with purpose - and that's how we've become a global market leader. Here, we grow by doing the right thing for the people we serve. And so can you.\n\nWe want to make success accessible to everyone. This is our opportunity. Let's make it count.\n\nInclusion Statement\n\nVanguard's continued commitment to diversity and inclusion is firmly rooted in our culture. Every decision we make to best serve our clients, crew (internally employees are referred to as crew), and communities is guided by one simple statement: \"Do the right thing.\"\n\nWe believe that a critical aspect of doing the right thing requires building diverse, inclusive, and highly effective teams of individuals who are as unique as the clients they serve. We empower our crew to contribute their distinct strengths to achieving Vanguard's core purpose through our values.\n\nWhen all crew members feel valued and included, our ability to collaborate and innovate is amplified, and we are united in delivering on Vanguard's core purpose.\n\nOur core purpose: To take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success.\n\nFuture of Work\n\nDuring the pandemic, we transitioned to a work from home model for the majority of our crew and we continue to interview, hire, and on-board future crew remotely.\n\nAs we have developed the path forward, we have taken a thoughtful approach that both maximizes the advantages of working remotely and the many benefits of coming together and collaborating in a shared workspace. We believe that in-person interactions among our crew are important for preserving our unique culture and advantageous for the personal development of our crew.\n\nWhen our Crew return to the office, many will work in our hybrid model. A smaller proportion of our crew will operate in the Work from Home work model (for example, field sales crew); or in the Work from Office model (for example, portfolio managers).\n\nThe working model that your role falls into will be communicated to you in the interview process - please do ask if you are unsure. We encourage you to make the decision regarding your job interview and offer knowing which model your role will fall into. We will test and learn as our ways of working evolve and will continue to evaluate working models along the way",

No more \"What do you want to do?\" \"I don't know...what do you want to do?\" With Cobble, everything we build is for getting people to a collaborative agreement\u2014faster, easier, and way more fun than texting back and forth with no end in... sight.\n\u2014\nWe do this through a combination of excellent curated content, and a suite of social decision-making tools. You might discover...your new favorite restaurant, a TV show everyone can't stop talking about, a one-time-only event, and so much more. Best of all? You'll actually do it because that's what Cobble is made for. Not another list app. A do it app.\n\u2014\n\nWe are an early stage company growing at the speed of light. We launched in June of 2020 in a fear-filled pandemic that had many people questioning if we'd ever be out in the world together again. Cobble always had that vision to say yes, and we're going to be a part of making it happen.\n\nThat's how our solo, first-time, female founder raised $3.3M in the middle of the pandemic. Now, we're finding out footing in the world and looking for brilliant people to join our team\u2014help us grow, help us continue nailing our product, and making Cobble a household name. Our team is distributed across the world, across cultures and backgrounds, and our leadership team is 80% female. Cobble was built with a spirit of inclusion and we're proud to keep up that reputation. Being remote isn't always easy, but we're pros at this point. Every year, we host Camp Cobble where all of our people come to New York for one epic week (you bet we use Cobble to make the best plans of all time).\n\u2022 *Requirements**\n\n- BS or MS degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience\n\n- 4+ years of relevant full-time Android development experience\n\n- Interest in the consumer space, willingness to roll-up sleeves and do hands-on development on day one\n\n- Experience with quick prototyping and working through ambiguities. We are defining our product specs through innovation and improvisation from every member of team\n\n- Solid understanding of object-oriented programming and familiarity with various design and architectural patterns\n\n- Ability to think critically about products and to shape technical and product strategy\n\u2022 *Additional skillsets:**\n\n1. Proficient in Kotlin\n2. Proficient with MVVM architecture\n3. Familiarity with REST based API, Firebase, and Amplitude.\n4. Experience working with animations.\n5. Excellent debugging and optimization skill.\n6. Well versed in with building UI using XML and custom UI components.\n7. Knowledge in Unit Testing.\n8. Good written and spoken communication skills\n\u2022 *Company Values**\n\n- Be curious.\n\n- Be a self-starter. Make it happen. Be thrilled to go the extra mile.\n\n- Be kind. Follow the golden rule\u2014treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n- Practice spontaneity. New growth stems from excitement, experimentation, and brainstorming. Look for spontaneous collaboration.\n\n- Be vocal\u2014in and out of the office. Be an advocate for Cobble wherever you go.\n\n- Don\u2019t bury mistakes. It\u2019s only a problem if only you know it\u2019s a problem.\n\n- Diversity is paramount. We\u2019re as inclusive as the couples who use Cobble, and the experiences we recommend.\n\n- Act with integrity. What do you do when no one is looking?\n\n- Act like an owner. When you graduate from Cobble in 5, 10, 15 years\u2014how is this place different because you were here?\n\n- Engage in fearless conversation. Something on your mind? Go to the source. Unsure of something? Be willing to ask for help.\n\n- Quality content is queen. What we do, we do well",
