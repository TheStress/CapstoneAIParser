We strive to foster an environment you can thrive in through our commitment to diversity, inclusion and belonging.\n\nOverview...\nSunrun\u2019s Design, Engineering, and Financial Services organization is seeking a Software Engineering Manager to lead innovation for a new team developing software to manage and automate the lifecycle of customer projects from sales to installation. Sunrun designs and deploys residential solar-powered energy solutions at a massive scale. We\u2019re really good at this, and now we need you to help us get better.\n\nThe complexities of designing and delivering these solutions to unique homes and properties are extremely challenging \u2013 we have all the problems of an energy company and a custom construction firm. Here are just a few of the problems you\u2019ll help us solve:\n\u2022 How do we design flexible and intuitive commerce APIs and operations for the wide range of products and services Sunrun provides? Unlike most other online shopping experiences, you can\u2019t just add \u201csolar power\u201d to your shopping cart and check out. Or can you?\n\u2022 How do we create the right separation of concerns so that our expert design engineers and construction planners can ensure a successful and efficient installation?\n\u2022 How do we optimize project fulfillment to get value to customers as soon as possible? How do we break up complex orders to install the car charger we have in stock today while we wait for other components?\n\u2022 How do we support retrofits, add-ons, and other common construction projects as part of a long term relationship with our customers?\n\u2022 Any given project could be worked on by a dozen teams across functions from finance to construction planning. We need you to develop the custom software systems that manage these workflows, providing a consistent and reliable abstraction over complex coordination details. Your work will power Sunrun, so Sunrun can power our customers\u2019 daily lives!\n\nAbout you:\nYou\u2019re a full-stack owner and are adept at guiding your team to create simple, intuitive, and reliable abstractions over complicated human and automated processes -- you understand how to create software systems that manage complexity so humans don\u2019t have to. You deeply appreciate the value of business agility, and know how to design flexible software systems that support rapid pivots to tackle new opportunities while minimizing technical debt. You relentlessly focus on operational excellence because when your software is down, Sunrun can\u2019t serve our customers -- you sweat the details and lead your team to do the same. You\u2019re passionate about power, energy, and renewables and are excited to define software systems and processes that accelerate the deployment of new solar power systems. You build high performing teams by putting in place the right structures to guide your engineers to deliver independently and consistently, while being a champion for sustainable, human-centered software engineering practices.\n\nWorried about making the change to work in solar power? Don\u2019t be! We\u2019re looking for strong, motivated, people-oriented engineering leaders who are excited to deliver products that fight climate change; we\u2019re happy to teach you everything you need to (or want to) know about the renewables industry.\n\nResponsibilities\n\u2022 Lead a full-stack team of software and QA engineers in the development of the software systems that enable our expert Photovoltaic System Designers, Electrical Engineers, and Structural Engineers to create accurate, code-compliant systems with a minimum of effort.\n\u2022 Collaborate with product management and your commercial and technical stakeholders to create software products that are not just viable, but lovable.\n\u2022 Define the short and long term strategy for your team, including how your software and people will need to grow and change to meet emerging business needs and industry trends.\n\nQualifications\n\u2022 Bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science or a related field, or equivalent work experience\n\u2022 8+ years of experience in software development, including 3+ years of experience directly managing a team of software engineers\n\nPlease note that the compensation information that follows is a good faith estimate for this position only and is provided pursuant to acts, such as The Equal Pay Transparency Act.

        "description": "Why We Need You\n\nAs a Senior Software Engineer in Platform, you\u2019ll help lead PagerDuty through a highly strategic transformation from a pure product to a platform. PagerDuty is transitioning from a set of products to a platform that consists of a set of configurable, flexible building blocks that can be leveraged to manage a variety of real-time work and real-time workflows. With that, we are... increasing our engagement with partners integrating other tools with PagerDuty, consultants building bespoke solutions, and customers customizing the platform and creating deeper integrations to fit specific environments and specific workflows. Come help us kick off the new Platform group, which will consist of a new set of product development teams who are building the building blocks of the new PagerDuty Platform.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help our customers better manage a variety of different types of real-time urgent work, not just in Software and IT Operations, but in a variety of other functions across the landscape of Digital Operations. In this role, you\u2019ll play a key technical leadership role across several development teams working to define and build a set of platform building blocks to manage real-time work and real-time workflows. The Platform team is working closely with other product development teams internally who will leverage these building blocks to build new products. We\u2019re also working closely with customers and partners to better understand their needs as it comes to platform flexibility and customizability; our larger, more sophisticated customers, in particular, are asking for a high level of customizability in terms of how they manage real-time work (such as alerts, incidents, post-mortems, security events, etc).\n\nKey Responsibilities\n\u2022 Think long term and partner with our Co-Founder and Platform GM and our peers in product management to build out a long term vision for the PagerDuty Platform.\n\u2022 Design and architect the set of flexible platform building blocks that will become the PagerDuty Platform.\n\u2022 Work backward from our multi-year vision and create a plan for the PagerDuty Platform that we can execute in multiple phases and that will deliver value to customers not just in the long term, but also in the medium and short term.\n\u2022 Create and implement a plan that will evolve our existing architecture, micro-services, and larger services into this new platform design, over the course of multiple milestones. To use a tried and true analogy, this will be like replacing the engine of the plane while mid-flight.\n\u2022 Collaborate closely across many different product development teams to validate and pressure test our new platform architecture, design, APIs, and user experience.\n\u2022 Be a coach and mentor to engineers of all experience levels. You\u2019ve been a technical leader and really enjoy mentoring and leading projects and driving technical excellence within the team.\n\nSkills and Attributes\n\u2022 You have extensive experience re-architecting a complex product and breaking a monolith up into multiple services / micro-services. You know the best practices of undertaking such initiatives as well as the pitfalls to avoid (and have the scars to prove it).\n\u2022 You are empathetic - you can clearly communicate your thoughts and opinions to others and facilitate these technical discussions to a successful outcome.\n\u2022 You do good work and lots of it; the drive to deliver is just a part of you.\n\u2022 You have excellent communication and collaboration skills.\n\u2022 You can prioritize and execute multiple tasks in a highly dynamic environment with a results-oriented mindset.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\u2022 You have 8+ years designing, developing, and managing customer-facing SaaS applications and web-based systems.\n\u2022 You have strong experience in designing and building REST APIs.\n\u2022 Experience in some or all of the following: Elixir, Ruby on Rails, Kafka, React.\n\u2022 Experience with agile (scrum, kanban, lean) delivery methodologies.\n\u2022 Public cloud engineering on AWS (preferred), Azure, or GCP platforms.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\u2022 You\u2019ve played a key role or contributing role on architecting or building a developer platform.\n\nThe base salary range for this position is 155,000 - 235,000 USD. This role may also be eligible for bonus, commission, equity, and benefits.\n\nOur base salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. The range, which is subject to change based on primary work location, reflects the minimum and maximum base salary we expect to pay newly hired employees for the position. Within the range, we determine pay for an individual based on a number of factors including market location, job-related knowledge, skills/competencies and experience.\n\nYour recruiter can share more about the specific offerings for this role, as well as the salary range for your primary work location during the hiring process.\n\nPagerDuty is a global company focused on inclusion and employee well-being by building a culture that isn\u2019t location specific and gives equal opportunity to everyone\u2014regardless of where you are working.\n\nAs a Dutonian, you can expect competitive pay and benefits; structured learning, development, and advancement; immersion in our award-winning company culture; and exceptional colleagues. PagerDuty currently has offices in Atlanta, Lisbon, London, San Francisco, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto, with remote opportunities in those countries and Chile.

There is a virtuous cycle between profitability and sustainability in many natural resource industries, especially agriculture. Better soil health, water conservation, and climate resilience often leads to lower costs, increased yields, and price premiums for crops or... livestock in the market. To reduce the upfront cost and knowledge barriers to implementing these practices, we are tackling an overlooked part of the operation: back office paperwork and financials. There\u2019s tremendous room for improvement on existing software and time-consuming paperwork shuffling in the farm back office. Over time, we\u2019ll expand beyond agriculture to drive sustainable practices in other natural resource industries: fisheries, forestry, water, energy, mining, and more.\n\nWe\u2019re a Series A startup backed by top investors (Thrive Capital, Homebrew, Designer Fund, BoxGroup, and more) and are looking for mission- and values-aligned individuals to join our fully remote founding team.\n\nLearn more about our mission and what it\u2019s like to work with us.\n\nThe opportunity\n\nAmbrook is building a world-class team.

Here are just a few of the problems you\u2019ll help us solve:\n\u2022 How do we design flexible and intuitive commerce APIs and operations for the wide range of products and services Sunrun provides? Unlike most other online shopping experiences, you can\u2019t just add \u201csolar power\u201d to your shopping cart and check out. Or can you?\n\u2022 How do we create the right separation of concerns so that our expert design engineers and construction planners can ensure a successful and efficient installation?\n\u2022 How do we optimize project fulfillment to get value to customers as soon as possible? How do we break up complex orders to install the car charger we have in stock today while we wait for other components?\n\u2022 How do we support retrofits, add-ons, and other common construction projects as part of a long term relationship with our customers?\n\u2022 Any given project could be worked on by a dozen teams across functions from finance to construction planning. We need you to develop the custom software systems that manage these workflows, providing a consistent and reliable abstraction over complex coordination details. Your work will power Sunrun, so Sunrun can power our customers\u2019 daily lives!\n\nAbout you:\nYou\u2019re a full-stack owner and are adept at guiding your team to create simple, intuitive, and reliable abstractions over complicated human and automated processes -- you understand how to create software systems that manage complexity so humans don\u2019t have to. You deeply appreciate the value of business agility, and know how to design flexible software systems that support rapid pivots to tackle new opportunities while minimizing technical debt. You relentlessly focus on operational excellence because when your software is down, Sunrun can\u2019t serve our customers -- you sweat the details and lead your team to do the same. You\u2019re passionate about power, energy, and renewables and are excited to define software systems and processes that accelerate the deployment of new solar power systems. You build high performing teams by putting in place the right structures to guide your engineers to deliver independently and consistently, while being a champion for sustainable, human-centered software engineering practices.\n\nWorried about making the change to work in solar power? Don\u2019t be! We\u2019re looking for strong, motivated, people-oriented engineering leaders who are excited to deliver products that fight climate change; we\u2019re happy to teach you everything you need to (or want to) know about the renewables industry.\n\nResponsibilities\n\u2022 Lead a full-stack team of software and QA engineers in the development of the software systems that enable our expert Photovoltaic System Designers, Electrical Engineers, and Structural Engineers to create accurate, code-compliant systems with a minimum of effort.\n\u2022 Collaborate with product management and your commercial and technical stakeholders to create software products that are not just viable, but lovable.\n\u2022 Define the short and long term strategy for your team, including how your software and people will need to grow and change to meet emerging business needs and industry trends.\n\nQualifications\n\u2022 Bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science or a related field, or equivalent work experience\n\u2022 8+ years of experience in software development, including 3+ years of experience directly managing a team of software engineers\n\nPlease note that the compensation information that follows is a good faith estimate for this position only and is provided pursuant to acts, such as The Equal Pay Transparency Act.

        "description": "WHO ARE WE?\n\nWe all need water; Waterly is revolutionizing the world of Water Treatment Plants and Wastewater Treatment Plants...\n\nWe are on a mission to modernize Water Operators' lives transitioning from paper and clipboard to digital water management utilizing IoT devices and SCADA systems. We enable Operators to gain insights into trending data, and generate operational and regulatory reports with ease. Our passion is for small to medium communities (population 1,00 to 250,000) who desire to digitize. With a 5-10% MoM growth, we currently have customers in 7 states and are excited to be rolling out to 16 states by the end of 2022!\n\nWaterly is positioned to take advantage of upcoming regulatory changes due to the increasing global (including US) water shortage, as well as emerging trends in automation, IoT, and smart-city initiatives as they move into smaller municipalities.\n\nROLE WE\u2019RE HIRING\n\nWe are hiring an awesome Senior JavaScript/TypeScript developer to join us in building both our frontend React app and backend TypeScript Node application!\n\nOur software team is growing, and we are currently a team of three; you\u2019ll be working remotely alongside our CTO, Senior Developer, and mid-level Software Developer. If you're located in the Chicagoland or Indianapolis area, we\u2019ll get to meet up in person more often!\n\nIdeally, you\u2019ll be familiar with React, TypeScript, Node, Postgress and have a curriosity in DevOps or Kubernetes -- but so long as you\u2019re well versed in TypeScript and have a curious mind, you\u2019ll pick up things no problem. We believe nobody starts in a role as an expert. We\u2019re here to learn, grow, and build amazing software.\n\nLooking at our roadmap, here are example projects you may work on with the team:\n\u2022 Helping build a visual dashboard that provides Water Operators visibility and insight into data entry progress and surface data problems (such as missing data, out of range values, etc.). Likely using D3.js or other visual libraries.\n\u2022 Helping build multithreaded/distributed backend services to process our many calculations from Operator inputs.\n\u2022 Helping build a more robust report system with e-signatures suitable for government submittal and archival functionality so that Operators may retrieve historical filed reports.\n\u2022 Building broader support of IoT enabled equipment that live streams data into Waterly through our WaterClick partner network.\n\nThis is just a taste; we have many exciting projects and problems to solve as we continue to scale and build impactful features.\n\nOur current tech stack:\n\nTypeScript / React / MaterialUI / Apollo GraphQL / TypeORM / Node / NX / .Net / Postgres / Auth0 / Docker / Kubernetes / Azure\n\nWHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?\n\nAs a Senior Developer, we would expect you to participate in planning features with both with technical and customer empathy. You\u2019ll likely have 6+ years of experience, but we care less about years and more about your personal growth, projects you\u2019ve worked on, and teams you\u2019ve worked with. We don\u2019t expect you to know much about water per-se, but you should be interested in learning!\n\nWe\u2019re looking for individuals who are curious, love to learn, and compassionate. We believe in assuming positive intent. We therefore believe in kind, open, growth-focused ideas and feedback. We deeply desire to see teammates succeed in reaching their potential. We love to celebrate individuals, team, and customer successes. We favor readable code over clever code. We trust each other and learn from each other. We strive only to be \u2018good\u2019 busy. We therefore also value a healthy work-life balance with an emphasis on life. We believe our work should be fun.\n\nWHAT IS THE SALARY & BENEFITS?\n\nWe pay our Senior Software Engineers $95,000 - 140,000 depending on their skills, demonstrated effectiveness, and demonstrated potential impact.\n\nWe offer healthcare, vision, basic life insurance, short & long-term disability, and basic dental benefits. We cover 100% of the employee\u2019s healthcare premium. We have a 401k plan with a match. We provide a generous paid time off plan, which does not include company holidays. We provide a $2,000 laptop stipend and will reimburse you for Internet and phone usage as well. Candidates that demonstrate leadership and driving consistent value to the organization will qualify for equity consideration commensurate with impact after 12 months of employment.\n\nWe encourage meeting our customers, going on tours of Water / Wastewater Treatment Plants and attending Water Conferences to grow our collective knowledge and appreciation for water!\n\nHOW TO APPLY\n\nRight here on Angle List!\n\nEQUAL OPPORTUNITY\n\nWaterly is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We provide equal employment opportunities to individuals who are qualified to perform job requirements regardless of their race, color, sex, religion, national origin, citizenship status, age, physical or mental disability, veteran, sexual orientation, gender presentation, or other legally protected status.\n\nWaterly focuses on Water and Utilities. Their company has offices in Indianapolis and Crystal Lake. They have a small team that's between 1-10 employees.\n\nYou can view their website at https://www.waterlyapp.com or find them on LinkedIn",
