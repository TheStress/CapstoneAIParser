About ReplitWere building the worlds most ubiquitous programming environment. We focus on inspiring creativity and generating value for creators through community, and we design simple yet scalable infrastructure primitives for the next generation of creators. We want to blur the line between learning and making a place where you can hang out, tinker with ideas, learn new concepts, and launch... a business all in the same day.About the roleThe platform team gives every Replit user a free computer in the cloud so they can learn and build. Your charter will be to give users more power in the cloud, make the system run faster across the globe, and save Replit a whole bunch of money along the way.To build and operate at scale, we need engineers with deep experience in distributed systems and/or operating systems.Examples of what you could do Leapfrog the Docker ecosystem by betting on Nix for building reproducible environments. Build a network file system by implementing Network Block Device protocol in our infrastructure. Create a hypervisor to manage user environments dynamically with snapshot and restore capabilities. Develop Replts infrastructure using Go, Rust, GCP, and IaC tools like Terraform.You are Able to demonstrate 5+ years of working experience with: Distributed systems (examples: platform-as-a-service, distributed storage, information retrieval) For example: Distributed storage systems, database internals, information retrieval, defining and improving SLIs, optimizing systems for latency or cost Someone who values simplicity and pragmatism (you think radically but ship incrementally). Self-directed and comfortable working autonomously.Bonus Points You have experience with the Nix ecosystem You like to play with Linux filesystems for fun You have optimized large scale distributed systems for performance and cost You have managed a public-facing project (you have launched projects with real users)Full-Time Employee Benefits Include: Remote-First and Autonomous Working Environment Flexible Work Hours Competitive Salary & Equity Home Office Set-Up Stipend Health, Dental, Vision and Life Insurance Short Term and Long Term Disability Monthly Expenses Stipend Parental and Baby Bonding Leave Flexible PTO (2 Weeks Minimum Required) + Holidays 401k Annual company/team offsites (4/year)Want to Learn More?
