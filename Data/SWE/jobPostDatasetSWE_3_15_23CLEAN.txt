Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and locationEverything we do at Sunrun is driven by a determination to transform the way we power our lives. We know that starts at the individual employee level. We strive to foster an environment you can thrive in through our commitment to diversity, inclusion and belonging.

Overview...
Sunrun’s Design, Engineering, and Financial Services organization is seeking a Software Engineering Manager to lead innovation for a new team developing software to manage and automate the lifecycle of customer projects from sales to installation. Sunrun designs and deploys residential solar-powered energy solutions at a massive scale. We’re really good at this, and now we need you to help us get better.

The complexities of designing and delivering these solutions to unique homes and properties are extremely challenging – we have all the problems of an energy company and a custom construction firm. Here are just a few of the problems you’ll help us solve:
• How do we design flexible and intuitive commerce APIs and operations for the wide range of products and services Sunrun provides? Unlike most other online shopping experiences, you can’t just add “solar power” to your shopping cart and check out. Or can you?
• How do we create the right separation of concerns so that our expert design engineers and construction planners can ensure a successful and efficient installation?
• How do we optimize project fulfillment to get value to customers as soon as possible? How do we break up complex orders to install the car charger we have in stock today while we wait for other components?
• How do we support retrofits, add-ons, and other common construction projects as part of a long term relationship with our customers?
• Any given project could be worked on by a dozen teams across functions from finance to construction planning. We need you to develop the custom software systems that manage these workflows, providing a consistent and reliable abstraction over complex coordination details. Your work will power Sunrun, so Sunrun can power our customers’ daily lives!

About you:
You’re a full-stack owner and are adept at guiding your team to create simple, intuitive, and reliable abstractions over complicated human and automated processes -- you understand how to create software systems that manage complexity so humans don’t have to. You deeply appreciate the value of business agility, and know how to design flexible software systems that support rapid pivots to tackle new opportunities while minimizing technical debt. You relentlessly focus on operational excellence because when your software is down, Sunrun can’t serve our customers -- you sweat the details and lead your team to do the same. You’re passionate about power, energy, and renewables and are excited to define software systems and processes that accelerate the deployment of new solar power systems. You build high performing teams by putting in place the right structures to guide your engineers to deliver independently and consistently, while being a champion for sustainable, human-centered software engineering practices.

Worried about making the change to work in solar power? Don’t be! We’re looking for strong, motivated, people-oriented engineering leaders who are excited to deliver products that fight climate change; we’re happy to teach you everything you need to (or want to) know about the renewables industry.

Responsibilities
• Lead a full-stack team of software and QA engineers in the development of the software systems that enable our expert Photovoltaic System Designers, Electrical Engineers, and Structural Engineers to create accurate, code-compliant systems with a minimum of effort.
• Collaborate with product management and your commercial and technical stakeholders to create software products that are not just viable, but lovable.
• Define the short and long term strategy for your team, including how your software and people will need to grow and change to meet emerging business needs and industry trends.

Qualifications
• Bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field, or equivalent work experience
• 8+ years of experience in software development, including 3+ years of experience directly managing a team of software engineers

With that, we are... increasing our engagement with partners integrating other tools with PagerDuty, consultants building bespoke solutions, and customers customizing the platform and creating deeper integrations to fit specific environments and specific workflows. Come help us kick off the new Platform group, which will consist of a new set of product development teams who are building the building blocks of the new PagerDuty Platform.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help our customers better manage a variety of different types of real-time urgent work, not just in Software and IT Operations, but in a variety of other functions across the landscape of Digital Operations. In this role, you’ll play a key technical leadership role across several development teams working to define and build a set of platform building blocks to manage real-time work and real-time workflows. The Platform team is working closely with other product development teams internally who will leverage these building blocks to build new products. We’re also working closely with customers and partners to better understand their needs as it comes to platform flexibility and customizability; our larger, more sophisticated customers, in particular, are asking for a high level of customizability in terms of how they manage real-time work (such as alerts, incidents, post-mortems, security events, etc).

• Create and implement a plan that will evolve our existing architecture, micro-services, and larger services into this new platform design, over the course of multiple milestones. To use a tried and true analogy, this will be like replacing the engine of the plane while mid-flight.
• Collaborate closely across many different product development teams to validate and pressure test our new platform architecture, design, APIs, and user experience.
• Be a coach and mentor to engineers of all experience levels. You’ve been a technical leader and really enjoy mentoring and leading projects and driving technical excellence within the team.

Skills and Attributes
• You have extensive experience re-architecting a complex product and breaking a monolith up into multiple services / micro-services. You know the best practices of undertaking such initiatives as well as the pitfalls to avoid (and have the scars to prove it).
• You are empathetic - you can clearly communicate your thoughts and opinions to others and facilitate these technical discussions to a successful outcome.
• You do good work and lots of it; the drive to deliver is just a part of you.
• You have excellent communication and collaboration skills.
• You can prioritize and execute multiple tasks in a highly dynamic environment with a results-oriented mindset.

Minimum Requirements
• You have 8+ years designing, developing, and managing customer-facing SaaS applications and web-based systems.
• You have strong experience in designing and building REST APIs.
• Experience in some or all of the following: Elixir, Ruby on Rails, Kafka, React.

• Public cloud engineering on AWS (preferred), Azure, or GCP platforms.

Preferred Qualifications
• You’ve played a key role or contributing role on architecting or building a developer platform.

We started Ambrook (ambrook.com) with a mission to help farmers become more profitable and more sustainable. There is a virtuous cycle between profitability and sustainability in many natural resource industries, especially agriculture. Better soil health, water conservation, and climate resilience often leads to lower costs, increased yields, and price premiums for crops or... livestock in the market. To reduce the upfront cost and knowledge barriers to implementing these practices, we are tackling an overlooked part of the operation: back office paperwork and financials. There’s tremendous room for improvement on existing software and time-consuming paperwork shuffling in the farm back office. Over time, we’ll expand beyond agriculture to drive sustainable practices in other natural resource industries: fisheries, forestry, water, energy, mining, and more.

We’re a Series A startup backed by top investors (Thrive Capital, Homebrew, Designer Fund, BoxGroup, and more) and are looking for mission- and values-aligned individuals to join our fully remote founding team.

Learn more about our mission and what it’s like to work with us.

Description
Hi, thanks for reading about our Principal Software Engineer opportunity! We're glad you're here.

We're Knack, a code-free platform used by thousands of customers — from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies — to easily build custom apps, workflows, and databases.

We need a brilliant engineer to help us meet the enormous challenges around managing a complex and diverse set of data with speed and reliability.

We’re looking for someone who’s not just an expert in programming, but who also cares deeply about application performance, and enjoys diving into the deep end of architecture and database use.

And did we mention self-motivated and a leader? We’re looking for applicants that want to join a fun, passionate and exceptionally talented team.

Knack is and has always been a 100% remote company. We started as a remote company so we know what it takes to ensure the success of a distributed team. TLDR: that essentially means that each member of the team has a huge amount of autonomy and ownership to define their work and impact.

We're looking for applicants that are opinionated about what matters to them and want to join a fun, passionate, close-knit crew of high-quality human beings that, above all, enjoy working together. Hopefully, that's you!

Please note - We are unable to sponsor visas at this time.

• Deep dive into Aurora PostgreSQL SQL performance challenges to optimize or change architecture for speed, scalability and reliability.
• Leverage tools such as New Relic, Performance Insights, and Data Dog to identify opportunities to improve performance for our large number of users.
• Drive innovative problem solving on challenging engineering problems, including: Caching, Real-time concurrency, and Container optimizations
• Refactor and modernize areas of the codebase, with an eye towards increasing maintainability, performance, and rapid iteration
• Collaborate with stakeholders, infrastructure and engineering teams to enable well-informed decision-making by: Bringing appropriate information to discussions, Clarifying scope and accurately presenting tradeoffs, Clearly communicating potential changes and alternatives along with associated pros / cons
• Be an inspiring and supportive teammate by participating in PR reviews, pair programming, active feedback, idea generation, teaching, learning, and generally being a delightful human being

We're looking for someone who is:
• Has proven experience solving performance problems on PostgreSQL and Node.js.
• Worked on a multi-region, multi-tenant SaaS application with a large number of users.
• Can go heads down to understand and find the root cause of a problem.
• Experienced as a meaningful contributor to a data-driven architecture at scale.
• Humble but opinionated. You have lots of ideas, yet you are happy to shift directions when a better path emerges. You take your work much more seriously than you take yourself.
• Hungry for meaningful work, and space to do it. Knack is a complex product in a complex space and the work is extremely challenging - but also deeply rewarding. Knack makes a major impact in the work of thousands of companies and organizations.

Our Stack:
• Back-end: JavaScript, Node.js, ES6
• Data: Both SQL and NoSQL, Postgres, Redis, Solr, ElasticSearch
• DevOps & Deployment: All things AWS, Jenkins, Github
• Testing: Playwright, Mocha, Jest
• Front-end: Vue.js, Webpack, SCSS

The biggest benefit of Knack is getting to work alongside our awesome team of Knackleheads. We're a funny, humble, talented team of delightful human beings that, above all, enjoy working with each other, growing with each other, and supporting each other.

These benefits aren't that bad either, though:
•  Define your work: find the location and environment that is best for your life and work.
•  Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You'll get required days off for birthdays and Knackiversaries.
•  Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together once a year at an amazing location to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.
•  HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).
•  401(k): we give you the option to automatically deduct funds from your pay to stash them away for your golden years (currently non-matching, but stay tuned!)
•  Equal opportunity: we push everyone to maximize their impact on our product and company--we strongly value all of our people, regardless of title or seniority.
•  Learning Credits - An annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.
•  Family support: we offer a generous paid family leave to welcome any new additions to your family.
•  Tech: we provide a top-of-the-line MacBook.
•  Referral Bonus: we think you're great which means you know awesome people! we offer a referral bonus to anyone you refer for an open position once they are hired as an official Knackster!
•  Workstation Allowance: we want your work from home space to have everything you need! we offer a workstation allowance to help with that

We know that starts at the individual employee level. We strive to foster an environment you can thrive in through our commitment to diversity, inclusion and belonging.

Overview...
Sunrun’s Design, Engineering, and Financial Services organization is seeking a Software Engineering Manager to lead innovation for a new team developing software to manage and automate the lifecycle of customer projects from sales to installation. Sunrun designs and deploys residential solar-powered energy solutions at a massive scale. We’re really good at this, and now we need you to help us get better.

The complexities of designing and delivering these solutions to unique homes and properties are extremely challenging – we have all the problems of an energy company and a custom construction firm. Here are just a few of the problems you’ll help us solve:
• How do we design flexible and intuitive commerce APIs and operations for the wide range of products and services Sunrun provides? Unlike most other online shopping experiences, you can’t just add “solar power” to your shopping cart and check out. Or can you?
• How do we create the right separation of concerns so that our expert design engineers and construction planners can ensure a successful and efficient installation?
• How do we optimize project fulfillment to get value to customers as soon as possible? How do we break up complex orders to install the car charger we have in stock today while we wait for other components?
• How do we support retrofits, add-ons, and other common construction projects as part of a long term relationship with our customers?
• Any given project could be worked on by a dozen teams across functions from finance to construction planning. We need you to develop the custom software systems that manage these workflows, providing a consistent and reliable abstraction over complex coordination details. Your work will power Sunrun, so Sunrun can power our customers’ daily lives!

About you:
You’re a full-stack owner and are adept at guiding your team to create simple, intuitive, and reliable abstractions over complicated human and automated processes -- you understand how to create software systems that manage complexity so humans don’t have to. You deeply appreciate the value of business agility, and know how to design flexible software systems that support rapid pivots to tackle new opportunities while minimizing technical debt. You relentlessly focus on operational excellence because when your software is down, Sunrun can’t serve our customers -- you sweat the details and lead your team to do the same. You’re passionate about power, energy, and renewables and are excited to define software systems and processes that accelerate the deployment of new solar power systems. You build high performing teams by putting in place the right structures to guide your engineers to deliver independently and consistently, while being a champion for sustainable, human-centered software engineering practices.

Worried about making the change to work in solar power? Don’t be! We’re looking for strong, motivated, people-oriented engineering leaders who are excited to deliver products that fight climate change; we’re happy to teach you everything you need to (or want to) know about the renewables industry.

Responsibilities
• Lead a full-stack team of software and QA engineers in the development of the software systems that enable our expert Photovoltaic System Designers, Electrical Engineers, and Structural Engineers to create accurate, code-compliant systems with a minimum of effort.
• Collaborate with product management and your commercial and technical stakeholders to create software products that are not just viable, but lovable.
• Define the short and long term strategy for your team, including how your software and people will need to grow and change to meet emerging business needs and industry trends.

Qualifications
• Bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field, or equivalent work experience
• 8+ years of experience in software development, including 3+ years of experience directly managing a team of software engineers

We all need water; Waterly is revolutionizing the world of Water Treatment Plants and Wastewater Treatment Plants...

We are on a mission to modernize Water Operators' lives transitioning from paper and clipboard to digital water management utilizing IoT devices and SCADA systems. We enable Operators to gain insights into trending data, and generate operational and regulatory reports with ease. Our passion is for small to medium communities (population 1,00 to 250,000) who desire to digitize. With a 5-10% MoM growth, we currently have customers in 7 states and are excited to be rolling out to 16 states by the end of 2022!

Waterly is positioned to take advantage of upcoming regulatory changes due to the increasing global (including US) water shortage, as well as emerging trends in automation, IoT, and smart-city initiatives as they move into smaller municipalities.

ROLE WE’RE HIRING

We are hiring an awesome Senior JavaScript/TypeScript developer to join us in building both our frontend React app and backend TypeScript Node application!

Our software team is growing, and we are currently a team of three; you’ll be working remotely alongside our CTO, Senior Developer, and mid-level Software Developer. If you're located in the Chicagoland or Indianapolis area, we’ll get to meet up in person more often!

Ideally, you’ll be familiar with React, TypeScript, Node, Postgress and have a curriosity in DevOps or Kubernetes -- but so long as you’re well versed in TypeScript and have a curious mind, you’ll pick up things no problem. We believe nobody starts in a role as an expert. We’re here to learn, grow, and build amazing software.

Looking at our roadmap, here are example projects you may work on with the team:
• Helping build a visual dashboard that provides Water Operators visibility and insight into data entry progress and surface data problems (such as missing data, out of range values, etc.). Likely using D3.js or other visual libraries.
• Helping build multithreaded/distributed backend services to process our many calculations from Operator inputs.
• Helping build a more robust report system with e-signatures suitable for government submittal and archival functionality so that Operators may retrieve historical filed reports.
• Building broader support of IoT enabled equipment that live streams data into Waterly through our WaterClick partner network.

This is just a taste; we have many exciting projects and problems to solve as we continue to scale and build impactful features.

Our current tech stack:

TypeScript / React / MaterialUI / Apollo GraphQL / TypeORM / Node / NX / .Net / Postgres / Auth0 / Docker / Kubernetes / Azure

WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

As a Senior Developer, we would expect you to participate in planning features with both with technical and customer empathy. You’ll likely have 6+ years of experience, but we care less about years and more about your personal growth, projects you’ve worked on, and teams you’ve worked with. We don’t expect you to know much about water per-se, but you should be interested in learning!

We’re looking for individuals who are curious, love to learn, and compassionate. We believe in assuming positive intent. We therefore believe in kind, open, growth-focused ideas and feedback. We deeply desire to see teammates succeed in reaching their potential. We love to celebrate individuals, team, and customer successes. We favor readable code over clever code. We trust each other and learn from each other. We strive only to be ‘good’ busy. We therefore also value a healthy work-life balance with an emphasis on life. We believe our work should be fun.

WHAT IS THE SALARY & BENEFITS?

We pay our Senior Software Engineers $95,000 - 140,000 depending on their skills, demonstrated effectiveness, and demonstrated potential impact.

We offer healthcare, vision, basic life insurance, short & long-term disability, and basic dental benefits. We cover 100% of the employee’s healthcare premium. We have a 401k plan with a match. We provide a generous paid time off plan, which does not include company holidays. We provide a $2,000 laptop stipend and will reimburse you for Internet and phone usage as well. Candidates that demonstrate leadership and driving consistent value to the organization will qualify for equity consideration commensurate with impact after 12 months of employment.

We encourage meeting our customers, going on tours of Water / Wastewater Treatment Plants and attending Water Conferences to grow our collective knowledge and appreciation for water!

Our Ways of Working

We’re a remote-first company with team members located across the United States spanning multiple time zones. We know how valuable the flexibility of remote work is for our employees so people can get the work done in the way that suits them best. With rare exception, our employees generally work 9-5 in their home time zone.

We also know that personal connection is the foundation for the great work we do together. In order to build community and collaboration, we gather in person two times a year at a full company offsite and a departmental offsite. These offsites are expected of employees and are great opportunities to meet the people you work with every day and to do some of the work that is much more difficult to do virtually.
