Pay: This project pays in equity. Once we begin generating revenue it will begin paying in cash.Description...Im developing a mobile application to help computer technicians and Helpdesk analysts dowork faster via intelligent search technology. The prototype helps them ask questions related to troubleshooting, repairs, maintenance, and laptop parts. The project is broken up into a text model and a image model, one answers query and the other displays images. use PDFKit to search for PDF fileswithin the laptop, iPhone, and MacBook hardware maintenance manuals on Dropbox. It will allow users toquery and pull up PDF files; mainly photos within the app to help them with tasks related totroubleshooting, assembly, and maintenance of laptops and iPhones.Im finishing up the developing of a mobile application to help computer technicians and Helpdesk analysts dowork faster via intelligent search technology. The initial version will use PDFKit to search for PDF fileswithin the laptop, iPhone, and MacBook hardware maintenance manuals on Dropbox. It will allow users toquery and pull up PDF files; mainly photos within the app to help them with tasks related totroubleshooting, assembly, and maintenance of laptops and iPhones. Knowledge of PDFKit, UIKit, CoreML, SwiftUI, Combine, Foundation, Swift Packages, and the fascination for research is required as well as a deep passion for working with Apple technology.Qualifications: iOS, Swift, Xcode, Alamofire, and SwiftUI.Responsibilities: Create a search function that relays user queries from iOS to IBM Cloud Object Storage using Alamofire, SwiftUI classes, UIKit classes, and then downloads the answer or image from OpenAI using the Aspera SDK for iOS. If it's an image it will download that from IBM Cloud Object Storage.Work with the UX/UI designer to implement the functionality for the SwiftUI images for the app.Create a script/parameter so that the the app knows where to route queries, whether its to the backend text model or the backend image model.Create a working prototype using the custom iOS tools the founder has invented.Beta test the app with Test Flight, DIAWI, or other suitable beta testing tool.Create a document uploading function so users can upload images or text for troubleshooting, visualization, and analysis.Edit the endpoints for the backend image model and create one for the frontend text model so the app is ready for the submission process to iTunes.Create an image model using the PDFKIT framework so that users can query our backend image database.Implement best practices to ensure the app is reliable and ready for use.Use the Swift Charts framework to create relevant graphs that computer technicians and helpdesk analysts can use to give more insights about into their work issues.
