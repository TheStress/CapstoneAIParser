We need an iOS app with the following features:1. Download, sign-up, login and basic account management...2. Pair/unpair to bluetooth devices.3. Location capture.4. Date and time capture.5. Run our pre-trained and quantized machine learning models. We provide the models, already adapted to run predictions on iOS. Their output is text-based.6. For each user, you capture the models' text output and send it to their account on AWS.7. A section in the app that fetches the text from AWS and allows the user to read it. The user should also be able to search through it - we'll provide the search algorithm, you have to allow querying and display the result.When applying, please propose your budget, timeline and include a portfolio of your past applications. Ideally they're similar or as close as possible to our requirements. Bonus points if your apps also hosted on-device ML models For each user, you capture the models' text output and send it to their account on AWS A section in the app that fetches the text from AWS and allows the user to read it
